# digitalsoil
app developed for the Agricultural field starting from the ground up, Soil.
Soil Foodweb Alliance wants a full setup for education and support on the Compost field.
Recipes for Compost, FieldWork Measurements are taken eather by hand or by Sensors connected as an IoT.  
Lab Work is also covered. The idea here is to set up a Compost Management Center for FieldWork and Management Purposes.
I also want to provide a place where you can buy related products and see reviews of them.

This project intentions are to automate as much as possible, while taking consideration of FieldWork condition. Our Main Terminal or Point is the Cell Phone as a Terminal.  Taking advantage of all its caracteristics such as gps, video, internet connection, bluetooth, etc.

Digital Soil, the biggining of digitizing soil and its organisms.  An Open Source Project.
