                <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2018 by <a href="#">Nina Folch</a></p>
                <p> {{ user.user_full_name }}{{ user.username }} Welcome! Now you can view what's happening with your soil.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Who We are <a href="#">Soil FoodWeb Alliance</a>, Founded in 2016, the Soil Food Web Alliance is an organization
                    and a grassroots movement that teaches how soil and soil biology can enhance ecological,
                    societal, and even personal health.  The Soil Food Web Alliance works to strengthen the relationship
                    we as humans have with soil, by teaching practical soil stewardship skills that have personal and non-personal applications. 
                    We work to reunite humans with the soil and to help all remember the importance soil has played in our biological and social evolution.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>As a philosophy, <strong>the Soil Food Web Alliance</strong> suggests that the highly resilient life cycles of soil biology and microbiology and their
                        interactions in nature serve as a powerful learning tool for how humans can best relate to each other and help steward the environment. 
                        We believe that many unique lessons can be gleaned from observing and interacting with soil microbiology and we work to communicate those insights
                        in hopes of inspiring others to do the same.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Our goals<em>over the comming years</em> is to continue building a thriving community of soil stewards around
                    the world, building a strong network of folks eager to engage soil in the design of ever-healthier ecologies. 
                    We believe our movement can succeed with strong communication, sustainable practices, and,
                    most importantly, widespread collaboration.</p>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to raise awareness about the importance of soil biology in the interest of nature and land preservation</p>
                <h3>Our Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To build an ecologically-conscious, solutions-oriented, and non-discriminatory grassroots movement
                        of applied soil stewards.</li>
                    <li>Increase soil microbial diversity, carbon sequestration, water quality, and soil health in disturbed habitats through the
                        dissemination of applied soil regenerative practices.</li></ul>
                <p>Our current efforts to accomplish these goals center on the development of this website into an information
                    database and networking hub.</p>
                <h3>Why Soil Biology?</h3>
                <p>We live in a unique era were the human connection to soil is becoming stronger, one could even argue that
                    for the first time in history, a clear awareness of the profound ecological importance of soil biology
                    which is paired with a consistent, accessible, and inexpensive techniques for cultivating these organisms. </p>
                <p>Soil biology (macro and micro) are undeniably the central importance to all ecological cycles.  Innovative
                    research in applied soil microbiology continues to demonstrate that soil microorganisms offer a unique
                    solution to a range of environmental issues.</p>
                <p>We at Soil Food Web Alliance believe in the power of our microbe allies to help humans address many global
                    challenges, but only if the awareness is built around this forgotten aspect of nature.
                    Throughout the natural world microorganisms act as primary regenerators of life and we see our work with
                    soil and soil biology as a unique means for learning from these organisms in the search for new paradigms
                    for regenerative human-ecological relations.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">The SWFA Volunteer Network</h2>
              <p class="blog-post-meta"><strong>The SFWA Network is an international, all-volunteer, grassroots network
                  of groups and individuals that share information related to soil biology and ecology, soil health, and
                  soil regeneration.</strong></p>
              <h3>PRINCIPLES</h3>
              <p>Members of the SFWA Network support their local communities by increasing access to information regarding
                  soil biology and ecology, for people of all backgrounds through the open dissemination of relevant
                  information in a manner that is egalitarian, all-inclusive, and does not discriminate on the basis of
                  age, gender, ethnicity, religion, mental health status, race, culture, sexual orientation, general
                  appearance, income level, living situation, or experience.</p>
              <h3>ORGANIZATION</h3>
              <p>SFWA Groups make relatively autonomous decisions around how to work in their local environment while
                  still being connected to and supported by the larger SFW movement.  SFWA Groups work autonomously in
                  their local region but are also networked together and supported in part through an online format.
                  How often SFWA Groups meet is an internal decision made by the group’s own members.  The SFWA
                  Collective is a small group that works to support the SFWA Network.  Branches help the SFWA Collective
                  develop a SFWA movement by providing suggestions on how to best evolve The Network.</p>
              <p>As the SFWA Network continues to expand, working groups will be established to help identify and
                  disseminate tasks among Network members that help support the SFWA movement.  These working groups
                  are open to Network contacts and chapters that wish to plug in deeper and help get work done.</p><br/>
              <h2>How to Help</h2>
              <p>Our mission is to raise awareness around the importance of soil biology and microbiology for
                  increasing the health of humans and the environment.</p>
              <p>We achieve this mission through the production of new ‘soil food web-focused’ media.
                  We make videos, hold interviews, write instructional literature, hold workshops, organize
                  internationally-attended events, and offer a range of visual learning tools and platforms.
                  Our programs and projects strive to meet various needs, as well as to create stronger connections
                  and community among current and future generations of soil stewards.  We strive towards a
                  soil-stewardship culture that is holistic and sustainable, and we emphasize appropriate technologies,
                  open community engagement, and environmental advocacy in all of our work – traits that distinguish
                  our work and help characterize the advocates, practitioners, and researchers we serve and work with. </p>
              <p>Our ongoing and upcoming projects depend on support to continue building on the momentum we have built
                  over the years.  If you feel our work is of service to you and your community, please consider
                  donating through our PayPal account. </p>
